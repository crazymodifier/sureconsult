            <h1>Limited Liability Partnership </h1>
            <p>Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) was introduced in India by way of the Limited Liability Partnership Act, 2008. The basic premise behind the introduction of Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) is to provide a form of business entity that is simple to maintain while providing limited liability to the owners. Since, its introduction in 2010, LLPs have been well received with over one lakhs registrations in India.</p>
            <p>LLP is one of the easiest types of business to incorporate and manage in India. With an easy incorporation process and simple compliance formalities, LLPs are preferred by Professionals, Micro and Small businesses that are family-owned or closely-held. Since LLPs are not capable of issuing equity shares, LLP should NOT be chosen for any business that has plans for raising equity funds from Angel Investors, Venture Capitalist or Private Equity Funds.</p>

        <h4>Difference between LLP & Partnership</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Authority:</b>
            <p>LLPs are registered in India under the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, Central Government. Partnership firms are registered with the Registrar of Firms, Controlled by the respective State Government in which the firm is registered.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Limited Liability Protection: </b>
            <p>The main advantage of a Limited Liability Partnership over a traditional partnership firm is that in a LLP, one partner is not responsible or liable for another partner's misconduct or negligence. A LLP also provides limited liability protection for the owners from the debts of the LLP. However, unlike private limited company shareholder, the partners of an LLP have the right to manage the business directly.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Number of Partners: </b>
            <p>LLPs and Partnership Firms must have a minimum of two partners to be registered. Post incorporation, a LLP can have unlimited partners. In case of a Partnership Firm, if the number of partners at any time reduces below the mandatory minimum of 2 due to death, incapacitation or resignation of a Partner, the partnership firm would stand dissolved. On the other hand, in case of a LLP, if the number of Partners reduces below 2, the sole Partner can still find a new Partner to fill the position without dissolution of the LLP.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Difference between LLP & Company</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Private limited company registration process and the LLP registration process are very similar with some differences in the documents and forms filed for incorporation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Cost: </b>
            <p>The cost for the incorporation of a private limited company or an LLP is the same.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Features: </b>
            <p>Both LLP and Private Limited Company offer many of the same features. LLP and Private Limited Company are both separate legal entities and have assets and liabilities that are separate from that of the promoters. LLP and Private Limited Company are both transferable, though a Private Limited Company offers more flexibility when it comes to transferring or sharing of ownership. LLP and Private Limited Company both have perennial life, unless and otherwise closed by the promoters or competent authority.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Fundraising:</b>
            <p>A private limited company can raise funds from Angel Investors, Private Equity Funds, Venture Capitalists, banks and NBFCs. An LLP can raise funds from Partners, Banks and NBFCs.</p>

          <li>The signed incorporation documents are submitted along with the application for the incorporation of LLP to the MCA. The approval from MCA can take anywhere between 2 - 5 working days. Once the approval is obtained, the LLP would be incorporated, and we begin the process of helping you obtain PAN for the LLP and opening of bank account in the name of the LLP.
