            <h1>Niti Aayog</h1>
            <p>In the period of Digitalization, now Government is focusing on maintaining a centralized database of all NGO/Society/Trust which want to avail government grant/funding to achieve their objectives. For that purpose, government has now, made it mandatory for all NGO/Society/ Trust to take registration in Niti Aayog before approaching any government department to present their project/ apply for government welfare scheme funding from them.</p>
            <p>The Government of India, in keeping with its reform agenda, constituted the NITI Aayog to replace the Planning Commission instituted in 1950. This was done in order to better serve the needs and aspirations of the people of India. An important evolutionary change from the past, NITI Aayog acts as the quintessential platform of the Government of India to bring States to act together in national interest, and thereby fosters Cooperative Federalism.</p>
