            <h1>About 12A Registration</h1>
            <p>12A Registration is the most initial step NGO’s need to follow to seek a Certificate of Exemption from Income Tax Department. It is important to note here that notwithstanding the fact that trust, society and section 8 companies are registered as per their respective acts, the registration under section 12A is necessary to claim exemption under Income Tax Act.

            <h1>About 80G Registration</h1>
            <p>80G Certificate is issued under Income Tax Act, 1961 to NGO’s by Income Tax Department. It is important to note that when registration is granted under section 12A, it does not mean that section 80G approval is to be given i.e. registration under section 12A will not provide automatic approval under section 80G. Section 80G applies only to charitable trusts or institution. It does not apply to religious trust or institutions. The primary objective behind the grant of 80G Registration is to motivate more donors to the organizations for donating funds. Furthermore, the donors receive a 50% tax exemption on his total taxable income. To avail this exemption, the donor must attach the stamped receipt against the donation issued by the NGO.</p>
